batteries physically degrade over time. meaning everything that has a battery. will inevitably need a replacement. however the shocking truth is that this. has become a big market for scammers. whether a diy repair or a phone shop. down the street let's see how to avoid. being scammed on a battery replacement. hi guys welcome back to another huge. jeffries video in this video we're going. to be exposing common replacement. battery scams remember when you could. tear off the back of your phone pull out. the battery and replace it in 15 seconds. not only was it convenient but the. company would also sell you a. replacement battery when you needed it. however almost all phones now have. internal batteries that are made hard to. access and remove whether this move was. so technology could advance or companies. realized why sell your replacement. battery when they can sell you a whole. replacement phone i'll leave that. thought with you but regardless the. market for third-party replacement. batteries is stronger than it's ever. been. i'm always coming across batteries which. claim to be higher capacity 100 original. or have some other insane claims these. high-capacity batteries are selling like. crazy with this particular listing. having sold almost 16 000 units in just. australia alone filled with hundreds of. positive reviews saying works a treat. just as described and honest seller the. battery only has three negative reviews. two claiming the battery isn't lasting. as long as advertised. there is also several neutral comments. stating the same thing. so i purchased two of these batteries. from two different sellers to find out. for myself. both batteries arrived unsafely packaged. an envelope is not how you ship a. lithium ion battery if anything sharp. were to impact the parcel in transit it. would likely result in the battery. combusting. both batteries claimed significant. increases over the original iphone 6s. and 5 cells which were. 1715 and 1440 milliamp hours. respectively. with the iphone 6s battery claiming to. have more capacity than the iphone 12.. at a closer inspection these are. apparently named business batteries with. the word business being horribly. misspelled on the iphone 6s battery the. spelling only gets worse around back. totaling 10 spelling mistakes across the. two sides. having a read it says i need to row. cycle or dispose off properly and to. reduce rosk of. filler or bernie. do not attempt to open disassemble. or service battery pack. do not crunch. puncture short external contacts. or dispose of in fire or water. do not expose to temperatures above 60. degrees. and replace only the battery pack des. elignated for this product. with such bad spelling and punctuation. that was a hard read but what isn't is. the real battery's capacity connecting. it to the jc pro 1000s we can read the. battery's management chip here we can. see its capacity of 1430 milliamp hours. 1250 less than advertised while it is. reporting 99 health with zero cycles. that is meaningless both parameters can. be reprogrammed using a device like this. so it could be a used battery with 500. cycles reprogrammed to have zero and 99. health. as for the second battery it's a similar. story being 100. milliamp hours less capacity than. advertised this one reports as an. original battery which could mean one of. two things it's a knockoff battery using. the same battery management chip or it's. a used worn out battery advertised as. having more capacity and then being sold. as brand new. it's time we dig a little bit deeper the. outer part of the cell appears to just. be wrapped by this gold sticker with all. of its fake claims the question is. what's underneath. oh. would you look at that underneath. is the real label. taking this horribly fake sticker off of. the battery reveals us the true capacity. printed on the front of the battery as. measured by my jc pro 1000 s this is in. fact a. 1440 milliamp hour knockoff apple. battery as i suspected. its manufacturing date sometime in 2018. as for the iphone 6s gold business. battery while it's a similar result the. sticker comes off but this time reveals. a totally blank battery with nothing but. a data matrix printed on the back of it. so it is a knockoff battery which of. course is not the advertised. 2850 milliamp hours. however these types of scams don't just. affect apple phones another example. comes from an old phone i purchased for. my collection. this sony xperia play from 2011 has in. it a so-called authentic sony battery. however just like the gold batteries the. sticker looked out of place. it has no spelling mistakes and even has. a shiny sticker which i suppose is to. make it appear legitimate however with a. manufacturing date of 2017. something didn't add up. peeling up the sticker instantly adds. seven years to the battery revealing its. real manufacturing date of 2010.. continuing to reveal the rest of the. battery it does appear to be a real sony. battery but a much older one. it's clear this well-used one was. rebranded and sold to someone as a brand. new replacement. when it comes to samsung phones. knockoffs are everywhere pulling out an. original galaxy s7 edge battery we can. compare it to a replacement. this one has expanded and has had a. minor explosion. while only quite small the battery no. longer charges and has done some damage. to the mid frame of the phone. when comparing the two batteries side by. side you can see the labels are not. printed at the same height the cable is. the wrong color and around the back the. cell lacks the barcode and accompanying. information. on the left are replacements i've. purchased and to the right are ones i've. pulled from phones based on my own. experience the knockoff batteries tend. to miss the writing on the back. one of my replacement batteries has that. text and in a closer inspection you can. see primarks indicating it's used and. been pulled out of a phone while i. believe it is genuine it's the only. samsung battery you don't want if you. know what phone this battery belongs to. leave a comment. now that you're aware of common scams. how do you avoid them and get a good. replacement battery my advice is to. steer clear of so-called genuine. products unless you can find a. legitimate business or company selling. them in the case of apple replacement. parts that's no one. look at buying from a well-known third. party something with a brand name this. ties the product with their brand. reputation a bad reputation and people. won't buy the product this means they're. likely to sell you something of. acceptable quality don't purchase from. marketplaces or websites where a seller. can hide behind a username buy directly. from the company and look up reviews on. the brand beforehand and if you're. getting a phone repaired by someone else. asked to see what batteries they use. if you want a guaranteed original. battery the only current choice is to. send it to the manufacturer with the. push for rights repair in many countries. around the world we can change this. right to repair would allow you or a. third-party store to buy genuine parts. and totally avoid these scams. i hope this video informed you about. battery replacements and the necessity. of right to repair and on that note this. has
