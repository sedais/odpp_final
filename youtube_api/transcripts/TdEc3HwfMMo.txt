iPhone batteries are rated to hold 80% of
their capacity for up to 500 charge cycles,. which lasts roughly 18-24 months for most
users.. When that happens, you may notice performance
issues with your phone, which means it’s. time for a new battery.. Today we are going to show you how to replace
the battery in your iPhone 13!. For this repair you will need A P2 pentalobe
driver, a Phillips #00 driver, a Y000 Driver,. An iOpener, a suction handle or iSclack, iFixit
opening picks, tweezers , a spudger, and some. isopropyl alcohol.. We also recommend using a magnetic mat so
you can keep track of screws, and write down. notes during your repair.. You will also need display adhesive to make
your phone retains its water resistance when. you reseal your phone, as well as battery
adhesive to make sure your battery isn’t. moving around after the replacement is finished.. Also make sure you are following the step
by step guide on iFixit.com as you will be. able to read tips and tricks that will help
you throughout the repair.. Before you start any iPhone repair, make sure
you discharge your battery to below 25%.. A charged lithium-ion battery can catch fire
or explode if you damage it.. Just a heads up before you replace your battery,
Apple requires replacement parts to be synced. with the iPhone after replacement and unfortunately
the software required to do this is not currently. available to the public.. After your battery replacement, your iPhone
may display a warning about the “genuineness”. of the battery.. You’ll also notice battery health and performance
reporting functions will no longer work, even. when using original Apple parts.. If your iPhone functions normally, you can
safely ignore all these issues.. To begin, power off your phone by holding
the side and bottom volume buttons.. Remove the two P2 pentalobe screws at the
bottom edge of the iPhone.. Grab a hot iOpener and lay the clear side
down along the bottom edge of the phone.. This will soften the display adhesive.. For the next few steps we are going to be
using a iSclack.. If you don’t have a iSclack on hand refer
to the repair guide on on our site where we. walk you through how to use a suction handle
to remove the iPhone’s display.. Once your iPhone is heated, grab the iSclack
and position its suction cups near the bottom. edge of the iphone.. Then press both cups firmly into place.. With the suction cups engaged, hold onto your
phone securely and close the handles of the. iSclack to slightly separate the screen from
the rear case.. For this step we’re not trying to fully
separate the display from the phone’s body. we just want to create a gap.. Once you see a gap between the display and
rear case insert a opening pick into the opening.. Next, place your heated iOpener on the left
edge of the iphone for about a minute to soften. the adhesive.. Then slide the opening pick around the lower
left corner and up the left edge of the iPhone,. making sure you don’t insert the pick more
than 2mm.. Once you are done on the left side lay a heated
iOpener on the ride edge of the iphone and. repeat this process.. Finally, place your iOpener along the top
edge of the iPhone.. Insert your pick into the right edge at the
top and slide it across the edge.. Be very careful and don’t insert the pick
more than 1mm here.. With all the adhesive separated you can now
open the phone by swinging the display up. from the right side like the front cover of
a book.. Don’t try to fully remove the display yet
though it is still attached via ribbon cables.. Lean the display against something like a
box or your driver kit so that the iphone. is easier to work on, and then use a phillips
screwdriver to remove the three screws securing. the battery and display connector cover.. Then remove the cover with your tweezers.. Use a spudger or clean fingernail and pry
the battery connector up from its socket on. the logic board, and bend the connector away
slightly so that you don’t risk the chance. of it making contact with the board.. Now disconnect the display cable connector
from the logic board.. Remove the two phillips and one y000 screws
securing the front sensor connector cover. and remove the cover with your tweezers by
swinging the cover towards the display to. unclip the hook.. Now you can disconnect the front sensor assembly
cable from the logic board-and your display. is now free from the rear case.. To have easier access to the adhesive pull
tabs securing the battery we need to remove. the loudspeaker, it’s held in place by four
phillips screws.. When those screws are out you can remove the
loudspeaker.. There are 4 adhesive strips with pull tabs
holding that battery in place.. To remove them begin by gently lifting up
the edges of the pull tabs and then use a. pair of blunt tweezers to peel the tabs away
from the battery.. Starting with the bottom strips, grab a tab
with your fingers and slowly pull it away. from the battery while holding the sides of
the phone.. Pull until the strip pops out and then repeat
the process for the pull tab next to it.. If a pull tab breaks or you are having trouble
removing the strips, grab some isopropyl alcohol. and apply some around the battery.. Tilt the phone so the alcohol penetrates under
the battery and then let it sit for a couple. of minutes.. Once that’s done the battery should lift
out with just a little force.. Check to see if your replacement battery came
with preinstalled adhesive strips.. If there are no strips in place check out
our video on how to install adhesive strips. on your battery.. Lay the battery in your phone gently and position
it so that your are able to connect the battery. to the logic board.. Once it’s in place press down on the battery
to activate the adhesive, and then disconnect. the battery using a spudger or your fingernail,
we don’t want the phone to be powered during. the rest of this repair.. Insert the loudspeaker and reinstall the screws
securing it to the phone.. Make sure your display has its adhesive strips
in place, if it doesn’t check out our video. walking you through the process of reinstalling
display adhesive.. This will ensure that your phone retains its
water resistance.. With the backing of the adhesive still in
place-align the display with your phone and. connect the front sensor cable and display
cable to the logic board.. Go ahead and connect the battery cable and
power on your phone to make sure it functions. properly.. If all is well, power your phone off and screw
the covers over the battery and display cables. back into place.. If your adhesive backing is still on go ahead
and remove it.. Now lay the display into position by aligning
the clips along the top edge and carefully. pressing the top edge into place.. If it doesn’t click easily into place check
the clips to make sure they aren’t bent.. If they do click into place easily, continue
pressing the rest of the display down.. Finally screw back in the two pentalobe screws
at the bottom of the phone.. For best battery results we recommend calibrating
your new battery.. We have a page walking you through the process
