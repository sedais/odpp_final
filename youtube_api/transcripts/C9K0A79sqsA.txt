to replace the battery in any smartphone. with the so called and non replaceable. battery you will need the replacement. battery itself which will cost about. fifteen pounds or twelve US dollars from. eBay and I open a microwavable heat bag. a set of plastic smartphone pry tools a. sharp razor blade or craft knife a set. of precision screwdrivers and optionally. a replacement rear cover or replacement. camera cover there are links to all the. items required in the video description. to start off make sure you're working in. a flat spacious and wellness environment. start by shutting down your phone and. then flip it over to lie facedown warm. up your eye opener in the microwave for. 60 seconds and then place it down over. the bottom cover like this for about one. minute to allow the gentle heat to. soften the glue after about a minute. remove the eye opener and use a sharp. razor blade or craft knife to very. gently lift up the cover once you have. enough clearance switch to using a soft. plastic tool and slide along the bottom. like this and then peel the cover away. but the eye opener back in the microwave. and repeat exactly the same process for. the top cover once both covers are. removed this will reveal two screws. behind the top cover and four screws. behind the bottom cover some of the. screws may be covered by a little screw. caps which can be leave it off and. discarded remove all six screws and then. remove the SIM card tray next use your. pry tools to gently unclip the back to. reveal the insides the first thing. you'll notice inside is a ribbon cable. running over the battery which connects. the motherboard up top to the daughter. board down below in order to remove this. first unscrew the metal plate to the. left of the fingerprint sensor and then. use a plastic pry tool to gently unclip. the ribbon cable at each end the battery. is also connected using a ribbon cable. so this can be unclipped in the same way. the battery is held down with some. pretty strong adhesive strips so this. next stage requires extra care and. attention as you don't want to bend the. battery in cause any damage which could. be dangerous. once the initial leverage has been. applied to the sides slide a credit card. underneath to separate the battery from. the adhesive until you're able to remove. it completely if your replacement. battery doesn't come with new adhesive. strips you can just peel these ones off. and place them back down and ready to. use with the new battery place down the. new battery in place of the old one and. connect up its ribbon cable. then reattach the other ribbon cable. between the motherboard and daughter. board and replace the metal plate being. shorted clip it in place at the non. screw end first then reattach the phones. back and clip it into place all the way. around before replacing all six screws. reattach the bottom cover. and if you've also bought a new camera. lens cover remove the protective sheet. before pressing that into place now turn. your phone back on. to check it boots up correctly and then. give it a full charge please give this. video a thumbs up and share it with any. of your friends who could do with a new. phone battery you can subscribe to the. switched-on network for free by clicking. the logo which is on screen now and feel. free to check out some of our other. videos too thanks for watching.
