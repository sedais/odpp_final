today's question is about a custom ROM. for Android called lineage OS is this. safer for your phone than using a stock. Android when I say safer I'm talking. about the spying that occurs on your. phone are you safer from that let's find. out next if you haven't heard of lineage. OS let me introduce you to it it's a. custom ROM meaning you can flash or. Android phone with this and use this to. replace Google's Android lineage os. originated from CyanogenMod which was a. popular custom ROM some years back but. the company that originally did it shut. down and many of the original developers. of CyanogenMod continued their work but. under a new banner called lineage OS I'm. running Linux OS on this 1+1 phone here. this phone was originally sold with. CyanogenMod you can use your phone. pretty much like a typical Android if. you switch to lineage OS or you can lock. down to limit google's view of your. phone so we will talk about these. options and see if this can make you. safer from a privacy point of view. obviously you're not much safer if. you're running Linux OS exactly like. Android with the same Google Apps but. before we can talk about lineage OS in. particular let me educate you on what. really happens on your spy device when. you're running Android what you're not. told about Android phones is that. there's a lot of spying on your. activities when you're using the phone. and much of this is being done without. your permission there are four main. categories of tracker threats that we. need to. about that are the all-consuming task of. your Android devices understand these. problems before you come to me and say. you are safer understand the threats I'm. not talking about cybersecurity related. to someone stealing your phone that's an. entirely different problem altogether. and may or may not be important it's not. important for me for example since I. don't put any important data on my phone. anyway here are the threats the Android. presents to us the number one threat. network scanning your device's scanning. for networks all day now this is not. some benign activity Google scans for. Wi-Fi routers and the MAC addresses of. those routers as well as signal strength. and GPS positions this is done. constantly this is used to build the. database that tracks every human being. with a phone this is the basis of Wi-Fi. triangulation a location method that is. more accurate than GPS and tracks you. indoors. unfortunately when your phone reports. the Wi-Fi routers near you the effect is. that you yourself are located precisely. as well this is a crowdsource activity. every Android phone in existence scans. for routers to mark your position and. consequently Google knows where every. single phone is at all times and much. more accurately than the cell phone. carrier they've got you within six feet. the number two threat is Wi-Fi. triangulation now this is similar to the. network scanning that I just mentioned. but it is the actual location tracking. as shared to third parties like apps. websites and shared sometimes with the. cell care. this uses the information about the. networks around you and then sends a. request to Google using the geolocation. API application programming interface. and Google returns your current location. this one is granted a permission for an. app to see I want to make sure the. difference is clear the network scanning. is permissionless this Wi-Fi. triangulation is for third party. location sharing this is not for Google. Google already knows where you are it is. my belief that just like an iPhone the. Wi-Fi triangulation logic itself is on a. chip on the Android device so this in. itself cannot be turned off by changing. the OS I've tested even using a gue new. Linux always like Ubuntu touch in the. triangulation is accurate still to six. feet indoors which tells me that this is. not using GPS GPS does not work indoors. and is not as accurate the danger of. Wi-Fi triangulation is that third-party. apps especially those with ads are. actually capturing everyone's location. and selling them for example a company. actually was able to identify all the. employees of Tesla by determining which. phones were at the Tesla plant this is a. major invasion of privacy the number. three threat is Google telemetry you. have to understand the Google. infrastructure here all Google apps are. submitted to the Play Store all Google. apps have to be written in Java and. packaged in a particular way with. libraries and the apps themselves are. only partially controlled by the. original programmer a lot of code is. added to each program as required by. Google each app then actually runs in a. captive container running an Android. specific virtual machine called Dalek or. Dex depending on the Android version. one of the libraries that programmers. use is called firebase this is part of. the Google cloud infrastructure so a lot. of the activities of many apps actually. involve using Google functionality this. can include the database notifications. payments in-app purchases usage. telemetry and can even track when the. phone is on what the phone is doing and. match it to other data like locations IP. addresses and your Google account. email address remember your Google. Account is part of the sign up to the. Play Store this will also have your. credit card info so Google knows. everything you're doing including what. you're spending who's near you where you. are and matching this knowledge based on. the telemetry from apps running the. Google infrastructure number for threat. is firmware spying this is a more. general category that I discussed. heavily in another video on Hardware. kill switches for phones there are parts. of your phone constantly leaking data in. acquiring data for example your Wi-Fi. adapter is sending out regular probes. that announce your MAC address you. cannot stop this this is being used by. evil players like Facebook to track who. we are connected to and what places we. frequent in addition the cell-based bad. modem is subject to many backdoors that. we cannot stop at the moment these. backdoors allow third parties usually. state level players to listen in to our. conversations capture our text messages. and even turn on our phones possibly to. eavesdrop these are just things that are. publicly known but the problem is that. the firmware in Android phones are black. boxes. these secret programs are running on. every phone and least have access even. to the main memory of the phone and. we're not exactly sure what is happening. this is why a company called purism. decided to build a new phone with. separate modules for the Wi-Fi and cell. baseband modem so they're external to. the main phone and added kill switches. to them to allow us to power them off ok. now where are we. we're talking about Linux OS and. wondering if lineage OS is safer than. Android and to answer that we will. assess Linux OS against the four threats. I mentioned first on threat number one. network scanning I'm happy to say that. this is not likely to occur in lineage. OS the network scanning is specifically. made to report the data to Google so. they can build a database of Wi-Fi. router locations since this OS is not. from Google then I will assume that this. is a genuine benefit to using lineage OS. in fact this benefit will exist. regardless of how lineage OS is set up. next on threat number 2 Wi-Fi. triangulation I believe that there will. not be any difference between Android. and Linux OS Wi-Fi triangulation will. occur a precise bearing on your location. that's what this is to many this is a. benefit because it helps you with. turn-by-turn navigation in a car however. this location is so precise to six-feet. that this kind of meta data is dangerous. since Wi-Fi triangulation likely occurs. at the hardware level a typical Android. device will be vulnerable to this at all. times it will be up to the OS lineage OS. in this case. to ensure that only apps with permission. gets to see it in any case we are stuck. here since the hardware cannot be. changed so this threat will not change. regardless of OS as long as the hardware. is for Android now at least this can be. controlled to some extent by permissions. number three threat is about Google. telemetry and this is the most invasive. of all the tracking because Google gets. to combine all the collected data not. just a single piece like location but it. can match it to true identities phone. status IP addresses your financial. activities your credit report on and on. this can be solved by the proper use of. lineage OS if you have the discipline to. not load apps from the Play Store and. here's the other problem and I know most. of you will not do this. losing a connection with Google means. your phone will no longer get. notifications I'm almost certain that. 90% of you will not go with that so you. will install lineage OS with the Google. Play Store if you do then telemetry of. some sort will occur if you only use. some Google Apps occasionally and mostly. stick to non Google provided apps or web. apps then it is possible that the data. collected on you will be less this is. part of the discipline that I know most. people will lock again you can still use. web apps web apps are safer than the. Google apps with built in telemetry one. possibility to think about is to install. the Google apps you want to use and then. remove the Google Play Store afterwards. again this may reduce the collected data. when the google apps are not in use. but once you install google apps even. the first time your phone is identified. with your Google email and. your credit card one of the advantages. of lineage OS is that you can rely on. apps from f-droid which has some open. source options it doesn't mean that the. f-droid apps themselves do not use. google firebase so it is still possible. to get tracked this is why this kind of. solution involves pretty intense. curation of every app installed on your. device I still think that Web Apps is. the better choice just use a browser and. run some web apps be careful of any app. with advertising and tied to Google. since those are the ones actively. selling your data the number-four threat. is firmware here there's nothing that. lineage OS will protect you against this. is the major problem with all Android. phones by Nature they're built to spy. and at best lineage OS is a partial. solution still given the rock in a hard. place that were in it is definitely an. improvement from a stock Android instead. of doing nothing in accepting a loss of. privacy using a lineage OS device allows. you to use a modern phone even a new. phone and have some control of your. privacy I prefer the more complete. solution of a Linux phone with Hardware. kill switches as on the liberal 5 but. absent that there's at least a way to. reduce the data available to Google now. some will ask how lineage OS compares to. a bunted touch from UB ports a bunted. touch works only on a few devices and. that is the major problem I believe it. is a safer device although it uses the. same hardware which is Android then it's. subject to the same threats on the. hardware side but apps on Linux are not. created using an Android ecosystem with. built-in Google telemetry so apps are. inherently safer people who build Linux. apps control the entire process of. and what's in it but because of the. popularity of Linux OS there are more. people doing programming and bugs are. fixed faster on lineage OS I would. rather use a Mon to touch if I can. though if there's a device I already. have or want and it's not supported I. don't get a choice or if there's a. particular feature that I need Mouse and. its buggy on a bun to touch then I'm. stuck to either way making some move. towards protecting our privacy is better. than doing nothing and if you're on an. iPhone there are no options the spying. is baked in I've left my iPhone at home. in spite of the inconvenience I have. tremendous satisfaction in knowing that. my data is not being harvested when I'm. out and about I hope you enjoy the video. please consider subscribing to the. channel I have regular live streams as. well and you can ask me questions or. debate me in real time. typically on Fridays and Saturdays at 8. p.m. Pacific Time thank you for watching.
