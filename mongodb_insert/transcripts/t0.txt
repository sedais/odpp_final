has been brought to my attention with. regards to my aunt drawing that ants in. fact have six legs and not four for this. I apologize A Bug's Life lied to me and. I should go outside more often now that. I've remedied this situation and our. Aunt has six legs the entomologist. should be satisfied and we can commence. with the pixel 6 Pro teardown let's get. started. [Music]. thank you. you might think that we would start on. the back of the pixel 6 Pro like other. Android phones but that's not the case. this time around Google has once again. designed the pixel 6 so that the screen. comes off first the phone is ip68 with. plenty of adhesive around the edge and. with the tiny bezels I'm taking extreme. care to not poke the side of the AMOLED. display under the glass because one poke. would destroy the whole thing. once the adhesive is sliced away onto. one side I can use my suction cup to. pull away the glass. and the whole phone opens up like a book. under the one T4 screw is a single. ribbon connecting the display to the. body I can pop that off just like a. little Lego. and the screen is free from the body the. pixel 6 Pro display is definitely the. easiest screen repair of 2021.. with the right tools and pre-laid. adhesive I better repair Tech and. replace a broken screen in about 60. seconds nice work Google thumbs up for. that now you might be like hey Jerry but. what about that fingerprint scanner and. you're correct there is one attached to. the screen but luckily this is an apple. we're talking about and Google has. provided a fingerprint calibration tool. that can be used online if your screen. ever does get replaced once again nice. work Google. the screen is still functioning I think. we should go deeper. there is a copious amount of black tape. covering the battery and circuit board. I'm curious if this is here to help. dissipate the heat at the front of the. screen. we have two more T4 screws down at the. bottom holding down the cutest little. bracket over the charging port this has. a white water damage indicator on it so. even though the phone is water resistant. this little sticker will turn pink to. tattle on you if liquid ever does seep. inside. we have seven more T4 screws holding. down the massive metal mid plate this. guy is pretty hefty and made with solid. metal I imagine these mid plates are. what make the phone so heavy and keep it. structurally solid it also acts as a. heat sink for the processor. there's another little guy up top and. finally with those metal plates gone we. can unplug the battery. the battery has a strange plastic pull. tab on it the adhesive underneath the. battery is still far too strong for it. to be removed with just a simple pull so. maybe this pull strip is supposed to. help slice through the adhesive. or maybe it's only meant to be lifted up. on after the isopropyl alcohol soaks the. adhesive underneath. because the ribbon itself isn't very. strong. I'll drip some isopropyl alcohol. underneath the battery to dissolve that. adhesive while we take a look at this. absolute unit of a camera unit. apparently the massive camera bump isn't. just for Aesthetics since the cameras. really do take up all that space inside. of the phone we have the 50 megapixel. main camera over here on the left with. ois then we have the 12 megapixel Ultra. wide camera which does not have ois then. on the right side we have the 48. megapixel four times telescoping. telephoto camera which also has the. internal Optical stabilization I took. one of these apart in my Galaxy s20. Ultra video if you want to see how that. works I'll leave a link for that down in. the description. now that the alcohols dissolve the. adhesive we can lift away the pixel 6. Pro battery it is a 5003 milliamp hour. capacity I'll remove four more screws up. here at the top and again up here we get. another strange metal chunk this would. normally probably act as a heat sink for. the 5G antenna the 5G antenna is. probably why the entire top of the phone. is made from plastic except that with. previous 5G phones that I've opened up. my 5G antenna has always been attached. to ribbon cables and this one is just. free floating I did a bit more research. and it turns out that my phone is an. international variant which does not. have the millimeter wave 5G so this. little guy is just an imposter that's. shaped like a 5G antenna and taking up. space this is normal though the phone. can still be called 5G without the. millimeter wave antennas not everywhere. has those frequencies the earpiece and. microphone both have red rubber rings. around the opening to help keep water. out along with these little foam balls. I'll unscrew four more T4 screws and. remove the SIM card tray. and then we get our first look at the. pixel 6 Pro's motherboard. which does have the front facing 11.1. megapixel selfie camera still attached. it's got the Lego style connector and of. course the USBC Port down here at the. bottom which is soldered in place it. does have a cool blue rubber ring around. the opening though the last thing we. have inside of the pixel 6 Pro is the. wireless charger also hidden under a ton. of graphite tape but it's definitely. back here I imagine that the rear glass. Replacements of the pixel 6 Pro are. going to be rather difficult but at. least the screen is quick and easy now. we just got to see if everything still. works when I put it all back together. overall I'm pretty impressed with the. pixel 6 Pro we learned quite a lot the. cameras are obviously a huge focus of. the phone since they take up so much of. the internal real estate we also learned. that Google has taken a few minutes to. think about repairability which is. awesome we learned that ants have six. legs I'm still not quite sure what that. battery pull tab was for though but hey. maybe that's on me I'll get the big. metal plate situated back on the. motherboard and get that single ribbon. cable for the screen plugged in with its. metal bracket and screw. once it's turned on our pixel 6 Pro is. as good as new of course though if you. want to see the insides of your own. phone from the outsides I do make it a. whole lot easier with my tear down skin. from dbrand I think the camera Hardware. looks even more impressive when you can. see how much space under the lens. they're actually utilizing grab a tear. down skin for your own device with the. link in the description hit that. subscribe button if you haven't already. and come hang out with me on Instagram. and Twitter thanks Don for watching and. I'll see you around.
