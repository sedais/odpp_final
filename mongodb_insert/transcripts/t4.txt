(upbeat music). - Everybody, David and David here. from PayetteForward.com. and UpPhone.com. and in this video,. we're going to tell you about. some Google pixel battery tips.. - And there are just a few tips. that we gonna mention,. and it's going to save
a ton of battery life.. So the first one has to do with 5G.. - Yep. So let's open the settings app.. swipe down from the top of the screen,. swipe down again. and just tap on that gear icon.. And I'm going to tap on
network and internet.. Going to tap on mobile network. and then tap on preferred network type.. - Right. So 5G is recommended. and if you live in an area. with good 5G coverage,. then by all means, leave this on.. But if you don't live in an area. with good 5G coverage,. I recommend selecting LTE.. First off, because LTE
can be faster than 5G. If you have a better LTE signal.. And second, anyone who's been in areas. where there isn't good cell phone coverage. knows that, when there
isn't good coverage,. your battery drains quicker.. So if there isn't good 5G coverage. and your phone is trying to connect to it,. your battery is going
to drain a lot faster.. So just choose LTE.. When you don't good 5G coverage here.. Just choose LTE.. - Yeah. So next one go
into privacy settings. under the Google pixel,. tap back and go back to the main page. of the settings app,. scroll down and tap privacy.. We're gonna tab advanced.. And we want to talk about. usage and diagnostic data.. - This is about sending data. to app developers and to Google. about the way that you use your phones,. that they can improve their products.. Is a little bit of cellular data. also uses your battery. to be collecting this data. in the background.. Lets let them improve their own products.. Just turn it right off.. - Yes, tap switch,. turn it off, well done.. We're gonna go back to the main page. of the settings app. and talk about some of location settings. and how locations Services. can be a really significant battery drain. for a lot of people.. - Right. We're not crazy.. We're not going to tell you. to turn off GPS in your phone. because that's what
makes the phone so great.. But if you're deliberate. and intentional about the settings. and the apps. that you want to have
access to your location,. you could save a lot of Battery life.. - Yep. Let's tap app access to location. and look at your apps,. especially allowed all the time.. Do these apps. need to have your location all the time,. even when you're not actively using them?. - Right. - And most of the time. the answer is going to be no.. - So even Amazon, Facebook, Google,. do these apps. need to have access to
your location all the time,. even when you're not using them?. Probably not.. And some apps. you might not want to allow. to have your location any of the time,. even when you're using it.. But these allowed all the time. are major battery drainers.. - Yes. So tap on Facebook for example,. and I'm gonna set it to allow. only while it using the app.. - Right. So ask every
time to be annoying, deny,. you're not going to be
able to tag your photos. with your location,. but allow while using the app,. everything still works.. - Yep. Let's go back. to location settings. under Google pixel.. And we're going to tap on
wifi and bluetooth scanning.. This allows your pixel. to scan for wifi and Bluetooth. Even when wifi. and Bluetooth aren't on.. - There are a lot of forum posts. about these two settings in particular. as being big battery drainers,. turn them both off. to save a lot of battery life.. - Yeah. And you'll still be able. to connect to wifi. and your bluetooth devices.. It's not like you're just
turning those features off,. you're turning off the scanning portion.. So tap, turn it off, tap turn it off.. Next thing we're talking
about, is dark mode.. It looks cool, and it could
help save battery life.. - Right.. - Win, win, let's go back to the main page. out of the pixel settings app.. And we gonna to scroll up. and tap on display.. Let's tap the switch next to dark theme.. - Wow!. - Look at that.. - Yeah. I mean, it makes sense, right?. This is one of those new-brainer settings. where the screen is a lot darker.. That's less power.. - Next. We're going to go
into the battery section. of the settings app. and talk about a couple of settings there.. I'll tap back. and I'll tap the battery.. One above display,. The first one is adaptive battery.. Go ahead and tap on that.. To extend the battery life,. adaptive battery may reduce performance. and background activity.. - So this is kind of automatically. doing some of the things. that we recommend doing manually,. but this can also help.. - Yeah. Let's have that
switch, turn it on.. - Right.. - And before we leave the battery section. of the settings app,. let's just go back. and let's talk about
battery saver a little bit.. - Yeah. I'm not a big
believer in battery saver,. even though some people. just turn it on. and then sort of forget about it.. Because if you optimize
the settings on your phone,. you can actually sometimes do better. than just having battery saver turned out. and not taking a look at anything else.. And battery saver. is kind of like this. catch all of thing that can actually. negatively impact some of the apps. that do want to have
access to your location.. I just avoid it if possible.. - That's especially true. for extreme battery saver,. which turns off even more. and it's.... - If you need a battery saver,. extreme battery saver. is a little extreme.. But it works. - Next. We're going to turn
on battery optimization. for all your apps.. This actually doesn't live
in the battery settings. for some reason.. So let's go back to the main page. of your Google pixel settings. and tap on apps and notifications,. tap advanced,. scroll down and tap special app access,. and then tap on battery optimization.. So here we have a list of my apps. that are currently not optimized.. And I was going to scroll down. Facebook, not optimized.. Facebook is a very significant
battery draining app.. You probably want to optimize. this app specifically,. for best battery life.. - Right. - So gonna go ahead and tap on that. and just tap on optimize, tap done.. It'll no longer appear in your list. of not optimized apps.. However, you can also
just tap on, not optimize. and then select all apps.. And then you can get all your apps.. We'll see that some are optimized
battery use, some aren't.. Good way to see which
ones are and which aren't.. - Right. And if you were. to go into the Facebook app,. all of a sudden. and you're to notice that. it was too slow. or that things weren't loading as fast. and it was a big pain in the but for you,. come back in here. and just turn this back on. or turn battery optimization off.. But if you don't really
notice a difference,. then you're just going to save battery. in the background.. So just bear in mind,. we're not commanding you. to do any of these things.. Just giving the option,. especially for apps like Facebook.. This can save a lot of battery.. - Next we're going to talk about. restricting background activity.. Apps can sometimes run in the background,. other than Google pixel. and just use a lot of battery life.. - Right. And this is kind of. a convoluted one to address,. but we're going to walk you through.. - All right. So let's go back. to the main page of apps notifications.. - Right. - Tap on to see all number of apps,. tap on an app, app on advanced. and then it tap battery.. Here we are, manage battery usage.. You see background
restriction right there.. App can use battery in the background.. And this is a gaming app.. If you have a lot of games in your phone,. you don't want them all
running in the background. of your Google pixel all
the time, draining battery.. - Yeah. You never know which ones. are actually gonna be
the biggest offenders,. especially if it's a third-party app,. not developed by a really big developer. can cause problems.. - Lets tap on background restriction,. to save battery stop bricks and balls. from using battery. in the background.. This app may not work properly. and notifications may be delayed.. Just tap restrict.. I don't need to have bricks and balls. send me notifications anyway.. As you said earlier,. this process is pretty convoluted,. that's what we have recommended. turning on battery
optimization for all apps.. And it kind of. reduces the need to go one by one.. And through this Kind of loaded process,. - Right. If this was the first tip. you would've stopped watching right away.. - Yes. - So like, anyway,. thanks for sticking with us. through this one. because it is kind of a pain.. - Yeah.
